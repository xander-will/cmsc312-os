## XOS: Simulated Operating System for CMSC 312
#### Written by Xander Will, Fall 2019

To build, run `build`, same for `run`

This program uses the MinGW runtime and thus may work on non-Windows machines... as I do not own one I have not tested it!

Process files must be written in JSON, please check the README in the processes folder for more information.
